Welcome to the documentation for the Rivu, a modern RSS 2.0 compliant feed
generator for Node.js with type-safety. This guide will help you install the
library, understand basic usage and get up and running in just a few minutes
using the package.

**TIP**: If this is your first time using Rivu, it is recommended to read this
page from start-to-finish.

## Installing Rivu

To install Rivu, you will [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed with a package
manager like `npm` accessible on your system. Regardless, to install Rivu with a
package manager of your choice, follow these commands:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    <Code code={`npm install rivu`} lang="console" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
    <Code code={`yarn install rivu`} lang="console" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
    <Code code={`pnpm install rivu`} lang="console" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Basic Usage

With Rivu installed and accessible, you can get started using the package right
away and generate an RSS XML feed for yourself. The following instructions will
help you generate the feed as a string output in your terminal.

1. Before you can get started with using Rivu, you will need to create a script
   which Node.js can execute. Name the script as `feed.ts` and take note of the
   `.ts` extension which means it is a
   [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.com) file. It is **RECOMMENDED** to
   use TypeScript over vanilla JavaScript to gain maximum benefits of the
   builtin type definitions and an improved developer experience with the
   package.

2. Add the following contents to the `feed.ts` file:

export const code = `
const feed = new Feed({
  title: "Lorem Ipsum",
  link: "https://jarmos.dev/feed.xml",
  description: "Lorem ipsum",
  items: [
    {
      title: "lorem ipsum",
      description: "lorem ipsum",
      pubDate: new Date("2025-10-10"),
    },
  ],
});

console.log(feed.generate()); `;

<Code code={code} lang="typescript" title="feed.ts" />

3. With the contents added to the `feed.ts` script, you should now execute it
   with the following command:

   <Code code={`node feed.ts`} lang="console" />

   <Aside type="caution">
     **NOTE** You will need at least Node.js v22 or above to be able to execute
     TypeScript files directly! Read the documentation on the topic to learn
     more - [Running TypeScript
     Natively](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/typescript/run-natively).
   </Aside>

4. You should then see the following output on your terminal.

export const feedOutput = `
<rss version="2.0">
  <channel>
    <title><![CDATA[Lorem Ipsum]]></title>
    <link><![CDATA[https://jarmos.dev/feed.xml]]></link>
    <description><![CDATA[Lorem ipsum]]></description>
    <item>
      <title><![CDATA[lorem ipsum]]></title>
      <description><![CDATA[lorem ipsum]]></description>
    </item>
  </channel>
</rss>
`;

<Code code={feedOutput} lang="console" />

As you can see, the output is serialised into a valid XML representation based
on the JavaScript inputs. Although the quick example above showcased a use case
to get a serialised output to the `STDOUT`, you can transfer the same ideas to
let's say generating a XML file.

<Aside type="tip">
  It is possible to use Rivu to generate dynamic RSS feeds using JavaScript
  frameworks like [Nuxt.js](https://nuxt.com). My personal website -
  [jarmos.dev](https://jarmos.dev) has a route
  ([jarmos.dev/rss.xml](https://jarmos.dev/rss.xml)) which dynamically generates
  the RSS feed for me on the server. If you use Nuxt.js as well and want to
  implement a similar functionality then you can check out [the source code of
  the
  implementation](https://github.com/Jarmos-san/jarmos.dev/blob/main/website/server/routes/rss.xml.ts)
  for inspiration.

Check out the [API Reference](/api-reference) to learn more about customising
the RSS feed according to your contextual requirements.
