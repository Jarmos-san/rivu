Rivu is an open-source software and hence relies of volunteer contributions from
users and interested parties for its development. If you are interested in
contributing to the project, you will find all the relevant guidelines in this
document.

## Reporting Bugs

Like any other software out there, Rivu is not immune from bugs and other
security vulnerabilities. Hence, the project relies on its users to report bugs
and security vulnerabilities to the project maintainers for resolving them.

You can report issues and unintended behaviour by opening a
[bug report](https://github.com/Jarmos-san/rivu/issues/new/choose). Or in case
of a security vulnerability, reach out to a maintainer privately. You will find
more details about it in the project's
[Security Policy](https://github.com/Jarmos-san/rivu/security/policy) document.

## Share Patches and Feature Enhancements

The project is open towards receiving volunteer contributions of patches for bug
fixes and/or feature enhancements. You can provide your patches and feature
enhancements using
[Pull Requests on GitHub](https://github.com/Jarmos-san/rivu/pulls).

<Aside type="caution">
  The feature enhancement patches should be within the boundaries of the [RSS
  2.0 specification](https://www.rssboard.org/rss-specification). Any feature
  enhancement requests or patches outside the scope of the official
  specification will be rejected.

## Sponsoring the Project

The project is open to receive (**an unobligated**) financial support towards
its development. You can help support the project by donating a minimum of a $5
one-time (or a month) through the
[GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/Jarmos-san) system.
